# BankChurnmodel_BI
The banking sector is undergoing rapid transformation, driven by technological advancements, evolving consumer preferences, and heightened competition. A key challenge facing banks today is customer churn—the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship with a bank. This issue not only affects a bank's revenue but also its market standing, making it a critical area of concern.
In response to this challenge, machine learning offers a powerful solution. With its predictive capabilities, machine learning can transform the way banks understand and address customer churn. By analyzing vast amounts of data, these predictive models can identify patterns and behaviours that signal a customer's likelihood to leave, enabling banks to take proactive steps to retain them.
This project report presents a Machine Learning Capstone Project focused on predicting customer churn within the banking sector. As competition intensifies and customer expectations rise, accurately forecasting churn has become essential for banks aiming to retain customers and enhance satisfaction. By understanding the factors driving churn, banks can develop targeted retention strategies, optimize customer experiences, and improve customer relationship management.
Through advanced analytics and data‐driven insights, this project aims to provide banks with the tools they need to better understand customer behavior and preferences, allowing them to address customer churn more effectively and maintain a competitive edge in the market. Background of this project is mainly situated for Australia where we are analysing customer churn for customers belonging to 3 major Australian cities which are Brisbane, Perth and Melbourne.
